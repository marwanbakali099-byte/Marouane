Hey there! 🛰️
I'm Marouane Bakali, a Geo-Information Engineering student and Full-Stack Developer.

I specialize in Spatial Data Science and GeoAI. My background in Mathematics and Computer Science (SMI) gives me a unique perspective on building intelligent systems that understand our world through data.

If there's a complex spatial problem, I’ll build an AI model to solve it and a full-stack application to visualize the results.

My main tech stack includes Python (AI, GeoPandas, TensorFlow), Java (Spring Boot), and SQL (PostGIS). I’m passionate about turning raw coordinates into actionable insights.

Currently, I'm deep-diving into Remote Sensing and Advanced Spatial Analysis as part of my first year in Engineering school.
